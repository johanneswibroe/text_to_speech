This script takes a list of words from a .txt file, 
pastes them individually into an online text to speech generator
and individually downloads the words. 

It does so by using selenium to open a browse, scan for a text box,
paste a word into, and then winauto to "hit enter" past a dialog box
and "move" the cursor to the download button.
